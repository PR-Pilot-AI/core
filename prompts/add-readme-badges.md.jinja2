Our goal is to generate badges for the README.md file to make it more visually appealing and informative.

Here is how you can determine which badges would be most useful for this project:

## Step 1: Gather project information
1. List the `.` directory and read the `README.md` file
2. Identify the project's main language and framework
3. Identify and read additional configuration files (e.g. `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `Makefile`, etc)
4. List the `.gihub/workflows` directory to see if there are any CI/CD or Github Actions workflows

## Step 2: Choose badges
Based on the information gathered, choose the badges that would be most useful for this project:
- Build status
- Any unit tests that are run as part of CI/CD or Github Actions
- Code coverage (ONLY if present in the project)
- Language or framework-specific badges (e.g. Python, Django, React, NodeJS, Java, Spring, etc)
- Code quality (e.g. linting, formatting)
- License

You MUST follow these guidelines:
- Only use values/version numbers/etc that are defined in the project, do not make up values
- Do not include badges that are not relevant to the project (e.g. no code coverage if there are no tests)

## Step 3: Generate the badges
1. Generate the badges with valid values taken from the information gathered earlier
2. Respond with the Markdown code for the badges
