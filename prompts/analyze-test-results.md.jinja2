We ran our unit tests, here's the output:

---
{{ sh('poetry run pytest') }}
---

If the tests are green, do nothing. Otherwise:
1. Identify the parts of the code that are not working.
2. Read the relevant files to get a better understanding of the problem.
3. Respond with a short, concise explanation of the errors and a suggestion for how to fix them
