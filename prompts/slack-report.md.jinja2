Create a report for me to read in the morning, so that I can catch up on what happened yesterday.
Use the following template to organize the content by topic and priority:

```markdown
*Daily Report for <date>*

<one paragraph summary of the day>

*_Highlights_*
<one or two things that seem extra important or urgent>

*<Topic 1>_*
<What I need to know about topic 1, with in-line links>

*_<Topic 2>_*
<What I need to know about topic 2, with in-line links>

...

```

Guidelines for writing the report:
- Use personal, concise, informative language.
- Topics should be content-oriented, e.g. not "Github issues" but "CLI history feature" or "Bug in dashboard"

Do the following:
1. Send the report to #daily-reports on Slack
2. Respond only with a link to the Slack message.
