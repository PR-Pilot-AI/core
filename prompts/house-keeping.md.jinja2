I'd like to do some house-keeping in the repository, help me with it!

1. List the `.` directory
2. Identify the types of files that get cluttered easily, e.g.: package.json, pom.xml, Dockerfile, etc.
3. Read a maximum of four of these files to understand their contents
4. Clean them up so they meet the criteria below
5. Write each of them back to file
6. Respond with a one-sentence summary of your changes and the list of files cleaned up

Criteria:
- Remove any commented-out code (unless it explicitly says "DO NOT REMOVE")
- Fix spacing / indentation issues
- Add comments to parts of the file that are not self-explanatory
- If possible and beneficial, re-structure the file to make it more readable

GO!
